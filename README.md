# Free-Reverse-Geolocation
Use the U.S. Census API to get coords for a given address. FREE!
Uncomment parts of the code for testing locally (only for function based).

geofun_r objects can be used for information only when you call for it.

revgeo objects combine all info at once with a call to Census API upon initialization.

***The precision for U.S. Census API is off from ~10 m - ~300 m. If you need accuracy I wouldn't use this script.***

My first every use of Git or GitHub. I apologize if this isn't perfect, I am new to this and need to learn.
